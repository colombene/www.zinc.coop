      <h1>Become a Contributor</h1>
      <p>Welcome! First off; <em><strong>THANK YOU</strong></em> for your interest in contributing to Zinc!
Your time is valuable, so let's get started!</p>
<p>Zinc products and services would stagnate without our <em>Contributors</em>.
Contributors suggest and implement changes to our products and services for
<a href="/maintaining/"><em>Maintainers</em></a> to apply.</p>
<p>Anyone and everyone can be a Contributor! All we ask is that Contributors follow
a few ground rules to help Zinc Maintainers and Contributors work well together.</p>
<h3>Contributor Ground Rules</h3>
<p>The keywords <em>must</em>, <em>must not</em>, and <em>should</em> in this document are to be
interpreted as described in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119">RFC 2119</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contributors <em>must</em> comply with Zinc's <a href="https://www.zinc.coop/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>.</li>
<li>Contributors <em>must</em> <a href="#legal">assign ownership</a> of their
contributions to Zinc.</li>
<li>Contributors <em>should</em> <a href="#getting-help">ask for help</a> when they get stuck.</li>
<li>Contributors <em>should</em> expect others to build their Contributions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can I contribute...</h2>
<h3>Features or requests?</h3>
<p>Gaps between what a Contributor <em>wishes</em> a product did and what it does is a
<em>missing feature</em>. Small, incremental features with clear use cases are the
easiest and fastest to build.</p>
<p>Contributors are encouraged to <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/issues">create a feature requests in the issue
tracker</a>.</p>
<p>To start building the feature, review the <a href="#development-guide">development
workflow</a>.</p>
<h3>Bug reports or fixes?</h3>
<p>Gaps between what a Contributor <em>expects</em> a product to do and what it <em>actually
does</em> is a <em><em>bug</em></em>. Bug reports that clearly express what was expected to happen
and what did happen are the easiest to resolve.</p>
<p>If you notice something unexpected in a product, please <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/issues">create a bug report in
our issue tracker</a>. We try to prioritize fixing bugs over adding
features.</p>
<p>If you want to try squashing the bug yourself; review the <a href="#development-guide">development
workflow</a>.</p>
<h3>Security concerns or patches?</h3>
<p>We take security seriously, but that doesn't mean we will always get it right.
We encourage Contributors to <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/issues">create a security report</a> with
security concerns.</p>
<p>If the concern may expose a vulnerability in a released version of a product,
please <a href="mailto:maintainers@zinc.coop">email the maintainers</a>.</p>
<p>If you think you can resolve the concern yourself; start by reviewing the
<a href="#development-guide">development workflow</a>.</p>
<h3>Documentation improvements?</h3>
<p>We strive for documentation to be findable, clear, and in plain language. If you
are unable to find an answer to your questions, please <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/issues">create a documentation
request in our issue tracker</a>.</p>
<p>If you think you can fix the documentation yourself, feel free to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-another-users-repository">use the
GitHub editor</a>.</p>
<h3>Translations?</h3>
<p>At present, we do not have a strategy for internationalization of our products
or documentation. If you have recommendations, please start a conversation in
our <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>There are two ways to get help; one is through <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/issues">opening a ticket in our issue
tracker</a>, where we will do our best to provide support in a
timely manner.</p>
<p>For people or businesses with urgent support needs, we offer professional
support at $250USD per hour. Support can be scheduled by <a href="mailto:maintainers@zinc.coop">emailing
maintainers@zinc.coop</a>.</p>
<h2>Development Guide</h2>
<p>This guide is the starting point for people who would like to directly modify a
Zinc product to fix a bug or enhance a feature.</p>
<p>If you are unsure what change you would like to make to a product, <a href="#find-something-to-do">find
something to do!</a></p>
<p>If know what you would like to change, start <a href="#learn-the-system">learning the
system</a>.</p>
<p>If you know what you want to change and are comfortable with the product's
design and architecture, Try to <a href="#make-a-change">make the change</a>.</p>
<h3>Find Something To Do</h3>
<p>We encourage Contributors to <em>&quot;eat their own dog food&quot;</em> and make changes that
are interesting or useful to them.</p>
<p>When that fails, we recommend taking a look at the open tickets in our <a href="https://github.com/zinc-collective/www.zinc.coop/issues">issue
tracker</a>.</p>
<p>The label &quot;Help Wanted&quot; is where we need some help. &quot;Good First Issue&quot; is for we
think new contributors can chip in. The labels &quot;Code&quot;, &quot;Design&quot;, or
&quot;Documentation&quot; indicate what particular skills an issue likely takes.</p>
<h3>Learn the System</h3>
<p><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/">Fork and clone the project repository</a> and review the
product design and architecture documentation found in the projects <code>README.md</code>.</p>
<h3>Make a Change</h3>
<p>First, review the dependencies and install the tools needed to build and run the
product. Many projects have automated these steps by including a script called
<code>bin/setup</code>.</p>
<p>We recommend Contributors write a test to isolate the bug or demonstrate the
feature.</p>
<p>Test are ran by executing <code>bin/test</code> within the projects top-level directory.</p>
<p>If you are unsure how to proceed at any point, please take some time to <a href="#learn-the-system">learn
the system</a> or <a href="#getting-help">ask for help</a>.</p>
<h3>Submit a Patch</h3>
<p>We closely follow <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">GitHub Flow</a>, with the following exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>We encourage contributors to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">create a draft pull
request</a> early, even if the work isn't 'done' as
this is the easiest way to <a href="#getting-help">get help</a>. Sharing work early makes it
possible for other Contributors to keep up with and build on top of the work
done, instead of needing to reinvent the wheel.</li>
<li>We name our primary branch <code>production</code>, <code>staging</code>, and <code>development</code> for
services and the major version (<code>0.X</code>, <code>1.X</code>, etc) for libraries.</li>
</ol>
<p>We encourage Contributors to name their branches in such a way as to indicate
why the branch exists. For example: <code>fix/login-error</code> or <code>enhance/typography</code> or
<code>document/how-to-contribute</code>.</p>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>Before Maintainers can merge a Contributor's changes, Contributors <em>must</em> grant
Zinc all rights to the work performed on the project by sending the following
message to <a href="mailto:operations@zinc.coop">operations@zinc.coop</a> or as a comment on your
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I assign all rights, including copyright, to any of my future work on Zinc
projects to Zinc Collective LLC.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>To put it bluntly, long term viability.</p>
<p>Copyright assignment grants Zinc the flexibility to decide how best to leverage
the changes Contributors provide.</p>
<p>Because Zinc is a cooperative, any Contributor may <a href="https://www.zinc.coop/operating-agreement/#b-2-becoming-a-member">become an owner of
Zinc</a>, granting rights to board representation and to share in
the near and long term wealth generated by our products and services.</p>
